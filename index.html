        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Greetings! I’m <strong>Marklewis Mwangi</strong>, a passionate Computer Science student at Kirinyaga University.
           Ever since I was young, technology has fascinated me—the way it evolves, how it connects people and the endless possibilities it offers.
           My journey into the digital world has led me to coding where I create, break, and refine systems to bring ideas to life. 
           For me, programming isn't just about writing code, it's about solving problems, creating something form nothing and constantly pushing the limits of what is possible.
           Art and gaming fuel my creativity, making me see the world from a futuristic perspective.
           Join me as we explore my exciting journey in my love for coding
        </p>

                <li><strong>Kirinyaga University</strong> - Pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</li>
                <p>Since childhood, I was always fascinated by computers—how they worked, how software was built, and how technology shapes our world.
                 When I finally got the opportunity to join Kirinyaga University and pursue a BSc in Computer Science, I was beyond excited.
                 The thought of diving deep into programming, algorithms, and problem-solving fueled my passion even more.
                 In the two years I have been at the university, I have learned and worked with multiple programming languages, including <strong>C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Python</strong>. 
                 Each language has broadened my understanding of software development, from low-level memory management to high-level application development.
                 Currently, I am exploring the world of cybersecurity through a platform called Hack The Box, where I test my ethical hacking skills, learn about vulnerabilities, and understand how security professionals protect systems from cyber threats.
                 My journey in tech is just beginning, and I am excited to see where it leads.

                 <p>During my time at Kagumo High School, I developed a strong foundation in academics and problem-solving.
                 My interest in technology grew as I explored computers and basic programming concepts.
                 Through dedication and hard work, I achieved a <strong>B+</strong> in my final year, which motivated me to pursue Computer Science at the university level.
                 High school was where my passion for technology truly began, setting the stage for my journey into the world of programming and cybersecurity.
